            This was my very first page that I built in 2021 when I started my
            coding journey. This is not a complex page but the whole building
            process was somehow soothing to me and brought that creativity
            sparkle back to my eyes which I have not had since my teens, and
            seeing the end result gave me a great sense of accomplishment.

            I have heard that for a new coder this is one of the best possible
            achievements: building a fully functional weather application. Here
            I was able to add many personal touches and I am very happy to be
            able to showcase my improved skills.

        <h4>A little bit about me</h4>
        <div class="about-me d-flex">
          I have worked as a tax lawyer for over 12 years before taking a leap
          of faith and moving to Seattle to earn a law degree with the purpose
          of joining the academia. Then I gradually realized that I needed to
          find a career that would nourish my soul by letting me be more
          artistic and authentic to myself while helping me understand where
          technology stands as a key to building the future. I was born into a
          Taiwanese family in S√£o Paulo, Brazil and am currently based in NYC
          which means I have a big heart split into 3 parts, each belonging to
          one country, besides having a big appetite as I try to make Brazilian
          and Taiwanese dishes when I am feeling homesick. My favorite Brazilian
          snack is p√£o de queijo, my favorite Taiwanese dish is Á≤ΩÂ≠ê, and my
          favorite American food is...well, I have not decided yet but will
          update this as soon as I find out! If you would like to learn more
          about me & my work, my contacts can be found below.
